# Welcome

Hello, and welcome to my site.

My name is **John Janes**, and I’ve been programming in one form or another for most of my life. This blog is a place to share my thoughts on technology and to document what I’ve learned over a **25+ year professional career in software development**.

## Operating Systems

My daily driver is **NixOS**, though I regularly work on macOS and Windows as well.  
On the server side, **Ubuntu** is usually my platform of choice.

## Programming

For personal projects, I’ve been diving deep into **Zig** and currently building a streaming application from the ground up. It’s still early days, but it’s been one of the most fun and rewarding projects I’ve worked on in a long time.

Professionally, I’ve worked extensively with:

- Go  
- PHP  
- Ruby  
- JavaScript 
- MySQL

## Gaming

Like a lot of kids who grew up in the 80s, my first gaming system was the old grey **NES hooked up to a CRT TV**. These days, I mostly play **Marvel Rivals**, **Battlefield 6**, and the occasional JRPG. You’ll also find me streaming from time to time under the tags:

> **drezdin** / **jjfishii**

## Streaming

I’ve been slowly building a library of gaming streams and development sessions where I work live on my Zig streaming project. It’s part learning journal, part experiment, and part playground.

## What This Blog Is About

This blog will be a collection of my thoughts on:

- Technology  
- Programming  
- Gaming  
- Tools and workflows  
- Experiments and side projects  

Right now, my focus is on **Zig**, **graphics**, and **low-level programming** — but that will naturally grow and evolve over time.

Cheers, and welcome to the site.
