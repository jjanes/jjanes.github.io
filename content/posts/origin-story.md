It all started in a dark alley.

It was 1992. I was 11. A shadowy figure leaned in and whispered,  
“Hey kid… this fell off the back of a truck. You interested in a *state-of-the-art Packard Bell*?”

No dummies. You didn’t really think that’s how this started, did you?

Gotcha.

## Christmas, 1993 — Berwyn, Illinois

The real beginning was Christmas morning, 1993 — at my grandparents’ apartment in Berwyn, Illinois.

Before any wrapping paper came off, something important was explained to me:  
I wouldn’t be getting *many* presents that year… just one big one.

What I didn’t know at the time was that my entire family had pooled money together for this moment. Looking back, I’m guessing it was close to two grand — a fortune in the early 90s, especially for a working family.

When I finally opened the box, I had no idea my life was about to be re-wired forever.

## The Machine

A Packard Bell.

A blazing-fast **486DX2**.  
**4 MB of RAM**.  
A massive **400 MB hard drive**.

Back then, this thing might as well have been a spaceship.

There’s that famous Bill Gates quote: *“640 kilobytes ought to be enough for anyone.”*  

Yeah… about that.

What I saw instead was something completely different:

An infinite world.

## Breaking Things (and Fixing Them)

I didn’t *use* that computer.

I **attacked** it.

I broke it in every way you can imagine — and a few you probably can’t.

I crashed it.  
Locked it up.  
Deleted things I shouldn’t have deleted.  
Edited things I didn’t understand.  
Reinstalled things I didn’t know I broke.

And then I fixed it.

Over.  
And over.  
And over again.

That loop — break → fix → understand → repeat — became addictive.

That’s where I fell in love with what I still call *being a hacker*.

Not in the movie sense.  
Not breaking into banks.

In the real sense:

> Someone who refuses to accept that something is “just the way it works.”

## The Hook

That computer didn’t just run software.

It **rewired how I thought**.

It taught me how to:

- Pull systems apart  
- Understand how things flow  
- Take nothing at face value  
- Build something better the next time around  

There was no roadmap.  
No YouTube.  
No Stack Overflow.

Just curiosity, trial-and-error, and a very abused Packard Bell.

## And the Rest Is Still Loading…

That moment — Christmas 1993 — launched everything.

A 25-year career.  
Countless projects.  
A lifetime of obsession with systems, storytelling, and machines that do more than they’re told.

This blog exists because of that computer.

Everything I build traces back to that machine.
